I've always liked the idea of having my own programmer blog where I can write about niche topics and my weird ideas. One big problem though is that I hate writing. 

I've wanted this for years yet I haven't started it yet because I end up obsessing over stupid details like:

- what static site generator am I gonna use?
    - Jekyll?
    - mdbook?
    - docusaurus?
    - Hugo?
    - Zola?
    - nextjs SSR with app router + MDX ?
    - Obsidian publish ($8 USD/mo)
    - quartz
    - how am I gonna sync the notes? I'd like to have the blog in Obsidian but also not publish personal notes

, resulting in decision paralysis and then never getting started. It's also more fun to think about over-engineering a solution rather than writing. 

Today I decided to just start writing a first post. It's gotta start somewhere and this is it. To be honest this post is already longer than I thought it was gonna be. I'm typing it on my phone before I go to bed. This text likely won't be public for a while until I figure out how I want to host this. Recently, I decided to write some self-reflection notes at the end of the day in Obsidian to get into the habit of giving myself some time to do that. Today, I decided if I want to have a stereotypical programmer blog, it's gotta start somewhere, so here is my first post.

Good night ðŸ’¤
