1lb. (450g) salmon ﬁllets
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 1 tablespoon olive oil or unsalted butter
• 1/4 teaspoon red pepper ﬂakes
• 1 teaspoon smoked paprika or more, to taste
• Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
• 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
• 1 medium onion, chopped
• 4 cloves garlic, minced
• 4 Roma tomatoes, chopped
• 6 oz fresh spinach
• 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped
• 1/2 cup (60ml) vegetable or chicken stock (or dry white wine)
• 2 tablespoons high-quality olive oil, optional

DIRECTIONS
1. To make the Tuscan garlic salmon skillet: Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a large skillet, on medium-low heat. Add the salmon
ﬁllets, red pepper ﬂakes, paprika, Italian seasoning, and salt in the skillet and cook salmon on medium heat on both sides, until
salmon is cooked through – about 5 minutes. Remove salmon ﬁllets from the skillet and set them aside on a plate.
2. In the same skillet over medium heat, add tablespoon olive oil or melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add garlic and chopped onion and
cook gently until fragrant and translucent. Add chopped tomatoes, chopped fresh basil leaves, fresh spinach, and vegetable or
chicken stock (or white wine). Cook on medium heat for about 3 – 5 minutes until spinach wilts just a little and tomatoes release
some of their juice. Adjust seasoning, if needed.
3. Add cooked salmon back to the skillet to reheat quickly. Drizzle with good quality olive oil just before serving, for extra taste.
Serve the Tuscan garlic salmon immediately, enjoy!
