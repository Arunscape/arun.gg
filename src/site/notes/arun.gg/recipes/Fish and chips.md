 Ingredients

    1 lb. of potato, cut long ways into fry/chip shape.

    12 oz fish, preferably a white fish like cod, pollock or hake

    1 lime or lemon for squeezing over fish

Batter

    1/2 cup of plain all purpose flour

    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

    1/2 teaspoon cumin

    1/2 teaspoon salt

    white pepper

    2 teaspoons baking powder

    2 tablespoons corn starch

    1/2 cup of soda water or beer (can use non fizzy liquids too, but the gas really does make for a better batter, IMO)

Cooking

    Chips/fries: boil the chips in water for 2 minutes. drain and rinse with cold water. let sit a side to drain for 5 - 10 minutes (until they're dry enough to go in hot oil without becoming lethal)

    fry the chips/fries at 300 degrees F. for 5 minutes, drain. Then fry again at 350 degrees F. for 8 - 10 minutes until golden brown and crispy.

    Fish: In a bowl, mix the flour and spices and baking powder together. then add the liquid while light stirring. beat it all together in a the bowl until it forms a thick batter consistency.

    dip fish in batter and completely cover the fish with it. submerge the fish in the batter for a minute or two to ensure it's well coated.

    fry fish at 390 degrees F. for 5 - 8 minutes or until the batter is crispy and golden.

Serve with beer(s) and your favorite condiments.
